Notebooks
=========

Notebooks covering key probabilistic and mathematical methods I've learned from my previous life working in computational physics, chemistry, and biology and current life working in data science.  I use these notebooks to learn and document these methods for myself.

Current Notebooks
-----------------

* Differential Equations and Markov Models
* Poisson Processes
* Sampling Methods
* Detecting Copied Text with Bags of Words and Naive Bayes Classifiers
* Introduction to FFTs

Ideas for Future Notebooks
--------------------------

* Practical explorations of NB using scikit-learn
* Ranking articles by relevancy using TextMine and Naive Bayes
* Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models
    *  MSMs and Differential Equations
    *  HMM architectures
    *  Applying HMMs to DSP
    *  Applications of MSMs and HMMs - proteins, sequences
* Clustering - KMeans, Hierarchical, MiniBatch
* Collaborative Filtering
* Differential Equations
* Stochastic Differential Equations
* Eigenvalues, eigenvectors
* Automatic feature extraction for unstructured data
    * Tokenization followed by probabilistic context-free grammars and optimization problem for extracting tree patterns
    * HMMs
    * Tokenize, extract token chunks, cluster
