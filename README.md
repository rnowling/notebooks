Notebooks
=========

Notebooks covering key probabilistic and mathematical methods I've learned from my previous life working in computational physics, chemistry, and biology and current life working in data science.  I use these notebooks to learn and document these methods for myself.

Current Notebooks
-----------------

* Differential Equations and Markov Models
* Poisson Processes
* Sampling Methods


Ideas for Future Notebooks
--------------------------

* Markov Models
* Hidden Markov Models
* Clustering - KMeans, Hierarchical, MiniBatch
* Collaborative Filtering
* Differential Equations
* Stochastic Differential Equations
* Eigenvalues, eigenvectors
